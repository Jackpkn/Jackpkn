## 🧠 About Me

With over 4 years of experience in full-stack development and a strong foundation in AI/ML systems, I build scalable, high-performance applications across web, mobile, and backend platforms. I enjoy solving complex problems and designing intelligent systems that push boundaries.

## 🤝 Connect

I’m currently open to **AI/ML**, **Full-Stack**, and **Tech-Leadership** opportunities.  
Feel free to reach out to collaborate or just have a tech chat.
